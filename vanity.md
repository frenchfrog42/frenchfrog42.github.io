Hi,
Thanks you for considering buying a vanity address.  
This is made by [@MSinkec](https://twitter.com/MSinkec)(did 90% of the work) and [1BaguettegL3S21U2erSNDYSe7UMJL2Y8v](https://twitter.com/NikamotoS)(did almost nothing)

Price indication for a random modern GPU:  
length<8: Time to solve = instant - Price = 1$  
length=8 (1Baguette): Time to solve = 8H - Price = 30$  
length>8 (or any other request): Please dm [@MSinkec](https://twitter.com/MSinkec)

If you want to buy an address, execute the app just below, and enter "deploy".  
It will ask for a privateKey (a WIF), and few informations (the prefix wanted, and the price in sats).
Do not ever share your WIF, and keep it (if something goes wrong or if you want your money back)!

Once you did everything, you get an "API response", which is a txid that you need to share with whoever wants to search for your vanity address!  
For instance share it on twitter and ping [@MSinkec](https://twitter.com/MSinkec). One day we'll have a nice looking page with all existing offers.

If you wish to execute the script yourself, please clone [this](https://github.com/msinkec/scrypt-vanitysearch).  
If you wish to search for vanity address, please clone [this](https://github.com/msinkec/vanitygen), and let us know what GPU you have, the price, etc...
